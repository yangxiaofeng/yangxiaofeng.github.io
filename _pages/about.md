I am currently a Research Fellow in NTU Singapore. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Nanyang
Technological University, where I was advised by Prof. Guosheng Lin. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor degree from NTU as well. My research interests include generative model theories (diffusion, flow matching), 3D generative models, post-training of diffusion models and multimodal learning.
